# Anvil

A single-binary BSV node. Verify transactions, publish data, get paid, let machines transact.

## Four layers

### Layer 0 — Verify

Validate any BSV transaction in 30 seconds with no blockchain download. Anvil syncs headers from a BSV seed peer (~940k headers, ~30s) and verifies BEEF proofs against the local header chain.

```bash
go build -o anvil ./cmd/anvil
export ANVIL_IDENTITY_WIF="your-wif-here"
./anvil -config anvil.toml
```

You now have a running SPV node with a REST API on `:9333`.

**[Layer 0 guide: Verify](docs/VERIFY.md)** — install, configure, verify transactions

---

### Layer 1 — Publish

Publish signed data to the Anvil mesh. Your app signs a JSON envelope, POSTs it to any node, and every node in the mesh receives it.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:9333/data \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"type":"data","topic":"oracle:rates:bsv","payload":"{...}","signature":"...","pubkey":"...","ttl":60,"timestamp":1710000000}'
```

Any consumer queries it from any node: `GET /data?topic=oracle:rates:bsv`

**[Layer 1 guide: Publish](docs/PUBLISH.md)** — envelopes, topics, signing, mesh gossip

---

### Layer 2 — Earn

Get paid per-request for your data or API. Non-custodial — the node enforces payment but never touches your funds. Add one field to your envelope:

```json
{
  "monetization": {
    "model": "passthrough",
    "payee_locking_script_hex": "76a914<your-address>88ac",
    "price_sats": 50
  }
}
```

Four models: `free`, `passthrough` (app collects), `split` (app + node), `token` (credential-gated).

**[Layer 2 guide: Earn](docs/EARN.md)** — payment models, x402 flow, configuration

---

### Layer 3 — Discover

Machines find, negotiate, and pay for services automatically. Every Anvil node exposes `/.well-known/x402` — a machine-readable menu of endpoints, prices, and payment models. An AI agent reads it, pays, and consumes. Zero onboarding.

```bash
curl http://localhost:9333/.well-known/x402
# → {"endpoints":[...],"payment_models":["node_merchant","passthrough"],...}
```

**[Layer 3 guide: Discover](docs/DISCOVER.md)** — machine economy, automated discovery, AI agent integration
